<p>Offer and access services in our communities,

<content-list>Contents</content-list>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Family businesses are often short of technical
  expertise to engage with clients without intermediary agents,
  who actually have a significant impact on the experience
  and affordability of a service.</p>
<p>The promise of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">internet revolution</a>
  was the development of social networks that
  can function independently and efficiently 
  allowing for greater freedom of information and engagement.</p>
<p>So far the technical advancement of the internet
  has increased access to various networks tremendously,
  however they exists inside centralized and industrialized systems
  exercising great influence on the quality and quantity information
  and engagement between market participants.</p>
<p>The challenge of this project is to continue the progress
  of the internet and develop the necessary freedom technology 
  for people to personally and mindfully explore and exchange
  what they seek and offer.

<p>The following prospective capabilities of
  <!-- <a href="#host">hosts</a>--> hosts and
  <!--<a href="#guest">guests</a>--> guests
  define our vision and our long term plans.
  We are progressively refine these areas as we learn more from
  both <a href="../research/index.html">research</a>
  and development and align our
  <a href="#priority">priority</a> accordingly.

        </blockquote>

        <p>To create a suitable space for comparison and competition,
          hosts may assign any one of the
          open standards to the service they are offering.</p>
        <p>Following similar standards across the market may help
          improve the quality of the service as the differences can
          become more visible and actionable.</p>
        <p>With standardization the guests may understand better
          the type of service they are subscribing to and match their
          expectations and evaluation accordingly.</p>

          and marketable units.
        </blockquote>

        <p>To represent the essential value provided across time,
          hosts may break down their service into tradable units
          that can be exchanged and redeemed for their underlying offer.</p>
        <p>The tokens bearing access to a service may be issued
          for the future so guests can submit or exchange reservations
          following market demand.</p>
        <p>As the credibility of the tokens increase
          the hosts may create franchises and alliances
          or exclusively control the supply of their scarce assets.</p>

        <p>To provide access to their services hosts may distribute
          vouchers to be redeemed according to their
          terms and standards.</p>
        <p>Recording the distribution of the vouchers in a decentralized
          network can help to avoid double spending and also to verify
          or recover the state of past and outstanding offerings</p>
        <p>Vouchers can become transferable between interested parties
          to find the highest bidder and to discover an optimal price
          for a service per supply and demand.</p>

          Modernizing the utilization of services
        </blockquote>
        <p>To allow access for guests to order or redeem services independently
          the hosts may use digital applications and electronic instruments
          to automate the mechanical parts of their services.</p>
        <p>Automating repetitive tasks can help to improve the overall
          service quality and reliability while also allowing more time to
          focus on personal and ethical exchange.</p>
        <p>Technical optimizations can create a more competitive
          and efficient market for the benefit of all participants.</p>

        <p>To prepare a plan of activities guests may search
          the open dataset of services according to their standard criteria either
          in their home or on their journey abroad.</p>
        <p>Looking through the lists of standardized services

        <p>Having a wide variety of recommendations via diverse

        <p>To use a service either immediately or sometime in the future
          guests may arrange reservations directly with their preferred hosts
          or exchange access to services by offers from other guests.</p>
        <p>The liability of canceling
          a reservation can become an asset for guests to
          transfer them freely to other parties who can make the
          best use of them.</p>
        <p>Guests can organize and bid according to their preferences
          independently an open market without technical limitation
          by the hosts capacity to facilitate.

        <p>To access services in a standard and enjoyable manner
          guests may redeem their orders securely either offline
          or online without interruption.</p>
        <p>As the hosts incrementally improve services their
          access can become as simple as guests scanning codes
          from screens or passes.</p>
        <p>Even physical access to locations or assets may
          be simplified with standardization and automation.</p>

        <p>To close the loop of improving services guests
          should be able to leave reviews safely and without
          risk of repercussion.</p>
        <p>Developing a healthy feedback mechanism can help
          selecting for the highest value and also create
          genuine opportunity for hosts to improve.</p>
        <p>Reviews can also sanitize stale or unreliable
          offerings from the network
          while keeping the market competitive.</p>
